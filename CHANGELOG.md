# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes to Augmented Workflow are documented here. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project uses semantic versioning for its installed and config surface. The version
below tracks `aw-version.txt` and the `.augmented-workflow-version` marker written
into installed repos.

Changes before 0.6.0 predate this changelog; see git history and `docs/decisions/`
for that record. `scripts/test-install.sh` fails if the current `aw-version.txt`
version has no entry here.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- `node .scripts/aw-gate.js check` now validates the **learning audit trail** in
  any repo with `gates.enabled: true`. Every `docs/learnings/*.md` must carry a
  non-empty `derived-from`, and `evidence-count` must equal the number of
  identifiers listed. A learning citing no session cannot be corroborated,
  expired on schedule, or traced back to where the lesson came from.

  Both rules already existed in `scripts/test-install.sh`, which runs only in the
  augmented-workflow repo and its test-install targets — never in a consuming
  repo, which is where learnings accumulate. The rule was enforced where the data
  does not exist and unenforced where it does.

  **This can fail a previously passing `check`.** The usual cause is a learning
  written mid-session by `aw-capture learning`: a session log and its
  `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>` identifier are not created until the session ends, so at
  capture time there was nothing to cite. Fix by adding the identifier of the
  originating session and correcting `evidence-count` to match. A repo with no
  `docs/learnings/` directory is unaffected, as is one with `gates.enabled: false`.

  A learning that genuinely has no session to cite — written before the repo
  adopted the memory loop, or imported from elsewhere — is exempted in the file
  itself with `audit-trail-exempt: <reason>`. The reason is required; a bare key
  exempts nothing. The exemption travels with the artifact rather than living in
  a list inside the tool, which cannot know a consuming repo's exceptions.

- `docs/features/workflow-effectiveness/spec.md` — a living spec defining what
  successful Augmented Workflow means and how it is measured, covering the metric
  tiers, the repeat-correction north star and its capture-rate guardrail, session
  identity for the audit trail, and deferred cross-session misalignment detection.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- `docs/solutions/` is now installed. `aw-capture solution` wrote there and
  `aw-refresh solutions` maintained it, but the directory was never created by the
  installer. New repos get `docs/solutions/README.md` describing the category
  layout. The tree is index-free and self-describing, like `docs/brainstorms/` and
  `docs/sessions/`.
- `skills/aw-capture/references/solution-doc.md` — the frontmatter schema, category
  mapping, and body template `aw-capture solution` had been pointing at through
  three reference paths that did not exist.
- `skills/aw-prd/references/prd-template.md` — the bundled PRD template
  `aw-prd` falls back to when a repo defines no `docs/product/prds/template.md`.
  Kept identical to the installed artifact by a drift guard.
- Two guards in `scripts/test-install.sh`: every `references/` or `assets/` path
  named in a `SKILL.md` must exist, and every `SKILL.md` must stay within a 2,200
  word budget. The first would have caught the four broken pointers above; the
  second applies the existing `AGENTS.md` budget discipline to skill bodies.

- Harness-portable GitHub access. `aw-commit-push-pr`, `aw-resolve-pr-feedback`, and
  `aw-debug` assumed the `gh` CLI, which does not exist in MCP-first harnesses
  (Claude Code on the web), sandboxed runners, or many enterprise environments. Each
  now resolves its path before the first GitHub action — **GitHub MCP tools when
  available, `gh` as the fallback** — and reports honestly when neither is reachable
  instead of claiming a PR or a resolved thread that was never created. MCP is
  preferred because it honors the harness's permission and repo scoping, while `gh`
  uses whatever token is on the machine and may act as a different identity. New
  `skills/aw-commit-push-pr/references/github-access.md` carries the command mapping;
  `aw-resolve-pr-feedback` documents the MCP equivalent of each of its four `gh api
  graphql` scripts and adds `mcp__github` to its `allowed-tools`. `gh api graphql`
  stays the documented path for comment-to-thread mapping, where it is more precise.
- `docs/standards/guard-verification.md` — a check that has only ever passed is not
  known to work. Promoted from a learning that reached three corroborating sessions;
  requires injecting the violation a guard exists to catch and confirming it fires.
- Durable artifacts now cite session logs by identifier (`YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`) instead
  of `docs/sessions/...` path. `aw-synthesize-memory` deletes processed logs past its
  retention window, so the two rules contradicted each other: the workflow required
  citing a path it also required deleting, making dangling references inevitable.
  `aw-capture` and `aw-synthesize-memory` learning formats updated, existing learnings
  migrated, and `scripts/test-install.sh` now fails when a session path appears in
  `docs/learnings/`, `docs/standards/`, or `docs/context/wiki.md`. A learning keeps an
  identifier for every corroborating session even after its log ages out, and
  `evidence-count` must equal the number of identifiers cited — both enforced.

### Changed

- `aw-work` now has a description with trigger phrases and disambiguation from
  `aw-debug` / `aw-brainstorm` / `aw-plan`. The old one — "Execute work efficiently
  while maintaining quality and finishing features" — carried no trigger cues on
  the workflow's most central skill.
- `aw-review` states the concerns a review must cover instead of prescribing a
  fixed roster of parallel subagents, and no longer directs which model tier to
  use for which reviewer. Fan-out is now an explicit choice based on diff size and
  concern independence; model selection belongs to the harness.
- `aw-work` phases 2–4 drop generic implementation advice already covered by
  `AGENTS.md` or by ordinary competence, keeping the workflow-specific content
  (test policy, standards, trace annotation, pins, e2e, ship-readiness evidence).
- The skill tracking preamble in all 21 skills is one line instead of two
  sentences. The in-skill emit is unchanged — see
  `docs/decisions/2026-07-27-keep-tracking-emit-in-skills.md` for why it stays out
  of a lifecycle hook.
- `docs/features/augmented-workflow/spec.md` gains three acceptance criteria (skill
  word budget, no dangling skill references, `aw-capture solution` storage) and a
  routing entry for `docs/solutions/`. Nothing was removed: the CLI surface and
  config keys are this product's observable contract, so they stay in the spec —
  `docs/workflow/gates.md` is shipped output that conforms to it, not its source.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Configurable end-to-end test authoring. New `workflow.auxiliary.e2e_tests.skill`
  routing key and a disabled-by-default top-level `e2e` block (`enabled`,
  `trigger_paths`, `test_paths`, `run_scope`). There is no bundled e2e skill —
  frameworks are stack-specific, so the workflow owns the slot and the contract
  while the repo supplies a Playwright, Cypress, XCUITest, or in-house skill.
  `aw-work` invokes it after acceptance criteria are mapped and before
  implementation edits, then runs authored specs per `e2e.run_scope`;
  `aw-check-workflow-compliance` reports in-scope changes shipping without e2e
  coverage or a stated exception. The config migrator adds the block with its
  defaults and rejects an invalid `e2e.run_scope`. See
  `docs/decisions/2026-07-26-add-e2e-test-authoring-capability.md`.
- Deterministic e2e coverage checking in `aw-gate.js trace`. Living specs mark
  requirements that need end-to-end proof with an exact `[e2e]` suffix on the
  requirement heading; when `e2e.enabled` is true, `trace` fails with
  `missing-e2e-coverage` if a marked requirement has no `@spec` anchor in a file
  matching `e2e.test_paths`. Near-misses such as `[E2E]` or `(e2e)` warn as
  `suspect-e2e-marker` instead of silently uncovering the requirement, and marks
  with an empty `e2e.test_paths` warn as `e2e-paths-unset`. This closes the gap
  where `untested-requirement` was satisfied by any test, e2e or not.
- A new installed standard, `docs/standards/e2e-coverage.md`, covering what earns
  an e2e test, keeping a ceiling on suite size, the marker convention and its
  suffix-only placement rule, where the decision is made, and why there is no
  override trailer.
- `node .scripts/aw-gate.js trace --suggest-e2e`, a read-only mode for repos
  adopting the `[e2e]` marker after an e2e suite already exists. It reports
  unmarked requirements already anchored in `e2e.test_paths` (`covered-unmarked`,
  safe to apply because the coverage is already there) and headings ending in an
  unhonored variant such as `[E2E]` (`near-miss-marker`), each with the current
  and proposed heading text and whether marking it starts enforcing coverage.
  Requirement prose is never inspected — what deserves end-to-end proof stays a
  human judgment made at spec time. Requires `trace.enabled` but deliberately not
  `e2e.enabled`, so candidates can be surveyed before the gate is switched on;
  it enforces nothing and exits 0 even while the enforcing `trace` run is red.
  Supports `--json` and `--out <path>`.

### Fixed

- `aw-gate.js` now reads YAML sequences written flush with their key, the form
  `upgrade-config.rb --apply` emits. Previously a migrated config parsed `trace`
  and `e2e` as arrays, leaving `trace.enabled` undefined — so `trace` reported
  "disabled" and skipped every check after an upgrade, a gate that looked green
  because it never ran. Predates this release; the round-trip is now covered by
  `scripts/test-install.sh` and `test/gate/e2e-coverage.test.js`.
- Marking a requirement `[e2e]` and adding the test it demands can be separate
  commits. Anchors found only through `e2e.test_paths` are exempt from
  `uncoupled-test-change`, which previously failed the commit answering a marker
  unless it also touched the spec or carried a `Spec-Override:` trailer.
- `e2e.test_paths` holding nothing but `:(exclude)` pathspecs now fails with
  `e2e-paths-exclude-only` instead of matching the whole repository and letting
  any test satisfy every marker.
- `suspect-e2e-marker` now catches markdown-decorated variants — `**[e2e]**`, a
  backticked `` `[e2e]` ``, and a trailing `[e2e].` — which previously read as
  marked to a human while enforcing nothing.
- `trace --suggest-e2e` exits 0 on pre-existing trace errors such as a duplicate
  requirement ID, matching its documented advisory contract; it previously
  aborted before printing a single suggestion, on exactly the repos it exists to
  serve. It also now reports `would-become-dangling` anchors and an
  `e2e.test_paths` that matches no tracked files, so the survey names what
  enabling the capability would break instead of reporting a clean tree.
- An invalid `e2e.test_paths` pathspec reports one `e2e-path-error` instead of
  two, and `trace --json` anchor counts no longer shift for repos that never
  configured `e2e`.
- The installer no longer corrupts an existing `docs/standards/index.yml` that
  lacks a trailing newline, and leaves index shapes it cannot safely append to
  intact with a `skip:` notice. Every bundled standard is now indexed through the
  same idempotent helper, so repos installed before `traceability.md` or
  `behavior-pinning.md` existed gain those entries on upgrade.

### Added

- Opt-in skill invocation tracking. New `tracking:` config block (disabled by
  default) and `node .scripts/aw-gate.js track <skill>` subcommand write a
  git-tracked JSONL line per skill invocation to
  `docs/metrics/skills-YYYY-MM.jsonl`, grouped into sessions via a gitignored
  `.aw/session` file. Fire-and-forget: no network calls, no keys, silent when
  disabled. Enterprise-safe. `aw-init --with-gates` registers
  `docs/metrics/skills*.jsonl merge=union` in `.gitattributes` and gitignores
  `.aw/session`; `upgrade-config.rb` injects the `tracking` section; the shared
  `prune-telemetry` command now prunes both `events*.jsonl` and
  `skills*.jsonl` shards. Design: `docs/workflow/tracking.md`.

### Changed

- `aw-check-workflow-compliance` reports missing e2e coverage whenever
  `e2e.enabled` is true. A configured `workflow.auxiliary.e2e_tests.skill` says
  who authors the tests, not whether coverage is expected, so repos writing e2e
  tests by hand are in scope.
- Rebranded the project and install surface as Augmented Workflow, including
  docs, package metadata, default remote source URLs, PR badge examples, and
  generated installer output.
- Renamed the install marker to `.augmented-workflow-version`, the installer
  environment variable prefix to `AUGMENTED_WORKFLOW_*`, and the living spec path
  to `docs/features/augmented-workflow/`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Proof-of-work receipts for freshness gates. When `gates.require_receipt` is on
  (the installer's default), `node .scripts/aw-gate.js record <gate>` refuses to
  stamp unless the skill has just written a fresh, gate-matching, single-use
  receipt via the new `receipt <gate> --summary "..."` subcommand — closing the
  gap where an agent could clear a blocked push by running `record` without
  actually running `aw-review`/`aw-capture`/`aw-check-workflow-compliance`/
  `aw-synthesize-memory`. New config: `gates.require_receipt`, `gates.receipt_dir`,
  `gates.receipt_max_age_minutes`, and per-gate `checks.<name>.require_receipt`.
  `--no-receipt` bypasses the check for bootstrap only.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Reference-repo behavior pins for migrations: `mode: reference-repo` manifests
  can compare the current repo to a pinned old repo/ref through a current-tree
  Node harness, with optional golden fixture provenance.
- Disabled-by-default `workflow.design` hooks for design-team participation at
  discovery, spec review, plan review, implementation review, and pre-PR
  checkpoints, plus repo-local design reference paths defaulting to
  `docs/standards`.
- `aw-help`, lifecycle skills, and workflow compliance now recognize configured
  design hooks so enabled design checkpoints are recommended, invoked, and
  checked as shipping evidence.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-16

Behavior pinning: an opt-in equivalence oracle for characterization-first work.
Pins run the same harness against an old tree and the current checkout so agents
can prove a rewrite preserved behavior before claiming success.

### Added

- `node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin run`, which reads
  `docs/features/*/behavior-pin.yml`, creates temporary old-tree worktrees, copies
  current oracle/support files into them, runs old and new harnesses, and writes
  `.aw/pin/equivalence.json` with distinct `pin-not-characterizing` and
  `equivalence-broken` verdicts.
- `node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin check`, which fails when one commit changes both
  a pin's subject and oracle/support files unless a `Pin-Override:` trailer is
  present.
- `pin.*` config defaults, `.aw/pin/` gitignore wiring, npm scripts
  `pin:check`/`pin:run`, a `Behavior Pinning` standard, and the
  `aw-pin-behavior` authoring skill.
- A self-hosted behavior pin for `.scripts/aw-gate.js` disabled-trace behavior,
  with `pin.enabled: true` in this repo.

### Changed

- `aw-work` now treats `characterization-first` as requiring a behavior pin before
  implementation and `pin run` during verification.
- The pre-push hook runs `pin check` alongside freshness and trace checks.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-16

Focused follow-up to spec traceability: deterministic workflow execution trace.

### Added

- `aw-gate.js workflow-record`, an opt-in process breadcrumb writer for facts
  such as selected workflow tier, step execution, skipped steps, and artifacts.
- `aw-gate.js workflow-check`, a deterministic checker for configured workflow
  breadcrumbs such as required tier selection and gate events.
- Automatic workflow-trace gate events from `aw-gate.js record <gate>` when
  `workflow_trace.enabled: true`, so review/compliance/synthesis execution can
  be checked without skill-specific extra logic.
- Disabled-by-default `workflow_trace.*` config defaults, installer migration
  support, docs, and an `npm run workflow:check` script.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-16

Spec traceability for living requirements, tests, and behavior entry points. The
feature is installed everywhere but **disabled by default**, preserving existing
repos until they opt in with `trace.enabled: true`.

### Added

- `aw-gate.js trace`, a deterministic checker that resolves `@spec` anchors,
  reports untested requirements, warns on missing code anchors by default, and
  can enforce test/spec change coupling with `--base`.
- `aw-gate.js trace-annotate`, a deterministic annotation proxy for skills. It
  no-ops when trace is disabled, supports direct and batch annotation requests,
  merges batch labels, and cleans safe `.aw/tmp/trace-intents.*.json` files.
- New disabled-by-default `trace.*` config keys, a `trace:check` npm script, and
  pre-push trace wiring after the existing gate check.
- Traceability documentation and standards covering requirement ID headings,
  test/code anchors, override trailers, batch intent cleanup, and the
  accountability-not-QA boundary.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-03

Enforcement, effectiveness telemetry, and org-shared knowledge — the three
enterprise gaps of unenforced standards, no measurement, and no cross-repo
knowledge reuse. Every new capability is **opt-in and disabled by default**;
existing installs are unaffected until enabled. To add the new config sections to
an older install, run `skills/aw-init/scripts/upgrade.sh --repo <path> --apply`.

### Added

- **Enforcement gates** via a dependency-free helper `.scripts/aw-gate.js`,
  installed with `aw-init --with-gates`. `record` stamps a git-ignored freshness
  marker (time + commit); `check` deterministically fails on stale gates for a
  pre-push hook or CI, with no agent required. Gate modes: `age` (wall-clock),
  `commit` (path-scoped change since the recorded commit, `--against head|worktree`),
  and `commit-and-age`. (#38, #40)
- **Telemetry** — an opt-in, no-PII JSONL event log written by `record`. Month
  sharding (`events-YYYY-MM.jsonl`), a `.gitattributes` `merge=union` rule that
  keeps concurrent appends conflict-free, and a `prune-telemetry` retention
  command. (#38, #43)
- **Org-shared knowledge** — `org_knowledge.source` adds an org-wide
  learnings/standards tier synced by `org-sync` and read by `aw-capture`,
  `aw-synthesize-memory`, and `aw-discover-standards`; it replaces the per-machine
  `~/.agents/learnings/` fallback as the second tier. (#38)
- **Org-knowledge governance** — an accountable-owner model, self-describing entry
  metadata (`authority`, `applies_to`, `owner`, `reviewed`/`review_by`, `source`),
  advisory-by-default with repo-local precedence, and a human-gated promotion path.
  Guide and templates in `docs/workflow/org-knowledge.md`. (#44)
- New config keys: `gates.*`, `telemetry.*` (including `rotation` and
  `retention_months`), and `org_knowledge.*`; the installer `--with-gates` flag;
  and a `.gitattributes` `merge=union` entry. `upgrade-config.rb` injects the new
  default sections into older configs. (#38, #43)
- New docs, installed into target repos alongside `README.md` and
  `field-guide.md` so a fresh install has the same reference surfaces the workflow
  points at: `docs/workflow/gates.md` (gates/telemetry/org how-to),
  `docs/workflow/org-knowledge.md` (governance), and `docs/metrics/README.md`
  (telemetry schema). (#39, #41, #44)

### Changed

- The augmented-workflow repository now dogfoods gates through a husky `pre-push`
  hook running `aw-gate.js check`. (#39)
- Documented the config reader's supported YAML subset beside the parser and in
  `gates.md`, to keep the hand-rolled reader on a short leash. (#41, #42)

### Fixed

- Commit-mode `paths` given as an inline flow array (`["src"]`) are now parsed and
  scope correctly, instead of being silently ignored. (#40)
- `org-sync` resyncs a **tag** ref (resets to `FETCH_HEAD` rather than a
  nonexistent `origin/<ref>`) and skips a bare or object-valued `source` instead of
  attempting to clone `[object Object]`. (#40, #42)

### Removed

- `operating_model.md` — a byte-identical duplicate of
  `docs/workflow/field-guide.md`. (#38)
