# Create Tickets

First action, if `.scripts/aw-gate.js` exists: `node .scripts/aw-gate.js track aw-create-tickets` (silent no-op otherwise).

Turn a plan into implementation tickets using the ticket system configured by the repo.

## Configuration

Read `docs/workflow/config.yml` first. Use:

```yaml
workflow:
  steps:
    create_tickets:
      skill: <skill-name>
```

If `workflow.steps.create_tickets.skill` is set to a custom skill, invoke that replacement step with the source plan/spec and ticket split. If it is blank or missing, use this bundled step to draft the ticket split and report that no external ticketing system is configured.

Removed legacy field: `ticket_creation.skill`. If it appears in an older repo, tell the user to migrate it to `workflow.steps.create_tickets.skill`; do not keep supporting both config shapes.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the source plan. Prefer the user-provided plan; otherwise use the latest active `docs/features/*/plan.md`.
2. Read relevant specs, decisions, and standards referenced by the plan.
3. Split implementation units into independently assignable tickets.
4. Preserve traceability in every ticket:
   - source spec
   - source plan
   - acceptance criteria
   - key files or areas
   - dependencies/order
   - test expectations
   - relevant standards and decisions
   - implementation entrypoint: `aw-work <ticket ID or URL>`
   - note that a future agent may start from this ticket alone after checking out the repo
5. If `workflow.steps.create_tickets.skill` is blank or missing, invoke `workflow.design.hooks.ticket_review.skill` when `workflow.design.enabled` is true and that hook is non-empty, passing the proposed ticket split. Then report the split and explain that no external tickets were created because no custom ticketing step is configured.
6. Otherwise invoke the configured `workflow.steps.create_tickets.skill`.
7. If `workflow.design.enabled` is true and `workflow.design.hooks.ticket_review.skill` is non-empty, invoke that design hook with the created ticket IDs/URLs and source plan before handing them to implementation.
8. Report created ticket IDs/URLs and the recommended first ticket ID/URL to pass to `aw-work`.

## Ticket Shape

Use the target tool's native fields when available. Each ticket should include:

- concise title
- outcome-focused description
- acceptance criteria
- implementation notes only where useful
- links to spec, plan, decisions, and standards
- labels/components/priority when the plan or target ticket tool implies them

## Rules

- Do not create tickets for unresolved product questions; surface blockers first.
- Keep tickets small enough for an agent to implement and verify independently.
- Do not duplicate the whole plan into every ticket.
- Blank `workflow.steps.create_tickets.skill` means use this bundled drafting step; do not ask the user to choose a ticket tool unless they asked to enable external ticketing.
- If Linear/Jira access is unavailable, draft the ticket set in markdown and explain what remains blocked.
